# COSC345 Group Project - Terms and Conditions:
This repository is for an android game developed as part of the COSC345 full year paper at the University of Otago, New Zealand. The theme of the paper for 2020 was anarchy, ironically enough. And as such we were tasked with making an application that could aggitate someone or somthing. So to fit this theme, game is intended as a satirical view of working as an Amazon Distribution worker. You have to screen orders to earn money and then spend, or not spend, it on life choices. It features some dark humour and one of 2020's hot products, the riot shield.

We developed it using Android Studio and the Java programming langauge.

# Releases:

## Store listing:
You can find the game available for open testing on the Google Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tommyhasselman.termsandconditions

## APK:
There is an apk of the game available in the repository under 'apk/release'. This release of the games includes the Dildo and Lolita Shirt items. These had to be removed for the play store listing, in order to comply with googles standards.

# How to play:
When you open up the game you will be presented with two buttons on the main screen; "Play" and "Options".

Selecting "Options" will give you the option to name yourself and to reset your save.

Selecting "Play" will bring you to the next screen; the Lobby. Here you will be able to see some relevant statistics for your playthrough. Crucially, the amount of money you have.

On this screen, you can select "Main Menu" to return to the home screen, or "Go to Work" to start the gameplay.

Starting the gameplay will bring you to the conveyor screen. Here you can tap on the 'order computer' and on the 'box'. These with both display a set of items. If all of these items match, you should tap "Correct" on the bottom of the screen; otherwise, tap "Incorrect". Doing this with accuracy is what will earn you money. When the time runs out, you may tap "Go Home" to continue.

Once you have completed at least five rounds, you will get a new screen after tapping "Go Home". Here you will be presented with a choice. Most choices have an option that will cost you money, and one that will not. Some choices can cause you to later lose the game, but if you spend too much money you will lose after being in debt for more than 3 turns.

Survive as long as you can, or until the game breaks. Have fun!

P.S: If you want to play around with the variables in the game / have a sneak peek at the backend. Set your name to 'debug' without the quotes.
