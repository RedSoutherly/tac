# COSC345 Group Project - Terms and Conditions:
Text based game with some graphical elements, Terms and Conditions places you in a dystopian American distribution centre where you have to check and form deliveries under increasing time restraints and scrutiny. The game plays homage to 'Papers Please' and pokes fun at a certain large American online retailer.

Written in Java using the Android Studio IDE.

# APK:
There is an apk of the game available in the repository under 'apk/release'. This release of the games includes the Dildo and Lolita Shirt items. These had to be removed for the play store listing, in order to comply with googles standards.

# Store listing:
You can find the game available for open testing on the Google Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tommyhasselman.termsandconditions

# How to play:
When you open up the game you will be presented with two buttons on the main screen; "Play" and "Options".

Selecting "Options" will give you the option to name yourself and to reset your save.

Selecting "Play" will bring you to the next screen; the Lobby. Here you will be able to see some relevant statistics for your playthrough. Crucially, the amount of money you have.

On this screen, you can select "Main Menu" to return to the home screen, or "Go to Work" to start the gameplay.

Starting the gameplay will bring you to the conveyor screen. Here you can tap on the 'order computer' and on the 'box'. These with both display a set of items. If all of these items match, you should tap "Correct" on the bottom of the screen; otherwise, tap "Incorrect". Doing this with accuracy is what will earn you money. When the time runs out, you may tap "Go Home" to continue.

Once you have completed at least five rounds, you will get a new screen after tapping "Go Home". Here you will be presented with a choice. Most choices have an option that will cost you money, and one that will not. Some choices can cause you to later lose the game, but if you spend too much money you will lose after being in debt for more than 3 turns.

Survive as long as you can, or until the game breaks. Have fun!

P.S: If you want to play around with the variables in the game / have a sneak peek at the backend. Set your name to 'debug' without the quotes.
